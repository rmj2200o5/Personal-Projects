# Personal-Projects
A collections of some of the first projects I worked on.
This repository includes files written in both Java and Python, as these are the first langauges I practiced. 
You may notice that the Python files included within do not utilize object oriented programming to the extent that all the java files do. This is because all the Python files were written before I learned about OOP in Python.
